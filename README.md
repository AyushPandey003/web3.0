
# Smart Contract Project

This project demonstrates the use of smart contracts with Vite as the front-end framework and Hardhat as the Ethereum development environment. The repository includes the Solidity contract code, deployment scripts, and a front-end interface to interact with the contract.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for the front end
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) for smart contract development and testing
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) or other Ethereum wallet for browser interaction

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-contract-project.git
   cd smart-contract-project
   ```

2. Install dependencies for Hardhat and Vite:

   ```bash
   npm install
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

### Compiling the Contract

Compile the smart contract using Hardhat:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

### Deploying the Contract

To deploy the smart contract on a local network, run:

```bash
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

To deploy on other networks (e.g., Rinkeby, Mainnet), update the `hardhat.config.js` file with the appropriate network configuration and run:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>
```

### Interacting with the Contract

1. Start the local blockchain with:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat node
   ```

2. In a new terminal window, start the Vite front end:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Running Tests

To test the smart contracts, run:

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

### Configuration

In `frontend/src/config.js`, configure your contract address and ABI to match the deployed smart contract.
